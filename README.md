Circular[0]
=============

A prototype for a Qix/Jezzball clone using a circular geometry (i.e. a "fencing off" type game). The prototype is mostly feature complete. I'll see if I make it into an actual game.

Installation
===========

Circular[0] runs using Node.js with the Express package. Follow these steps to get the server running:

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Open the Node.js command prompt.
3. Switch to the directory containing Circular\[0\] (using the `cd` command).
4. Install the Express package (by running `npm install`, the install data is already in `package.json`).
5. Run your server by running `node server.js` in the Node.js command prompt.
6. Now you can play the game at `http://localhost:1618/`.
